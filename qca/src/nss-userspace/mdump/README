		mdump	System memory space dump utility

1) Usage
mdump program is used to dump system memory content for debugging
NSS firmware (FW) after system crashed.

By default, it will dump 16 MB NSS FW DDR content start from address
0x4000_0000. The 16 MB is the minimum DDR information required for
debugging NSS FW crash. The more the memory content can be dumpped,
the better chance for engineer to caugh the issue. However, the maximum
output file size is 512MB. If the system memory is bigger then 512 MB,
then dump 512 MB at a time.

If only one DDR file is dumpped, name it NSSDDR.BIN.
If more then one DDR files are created, name them as
EBICS0.BIN
EBICS1.BIN
EBICS2.BIN, etc.

mdump has two options: -a #### and -b #### and
"####" can be either hex or digital number.
The "-b bytes" option is for changing the dump size, and
the "-a address" option is for change the dumping start address in DDR.

Besides to dump DDR, NSS also has a TCM memory needs to be dumpped for debug.
The TCM (tight-couple memory) starting address may vary from chip to chip.
For IPQ806x chip (Akronite), the TCM starting address is at 0x3900_0000.
For IPQ807x chip (Hawkeye), the TCM starting address is at 0x3800_0000.
For Remora chip (Femto), the TCM starting address is at 0xE400_0000.
etc.  The TCM size is 128KB (may be 256KB) and command for dumping Akronite
TCM is like below:

	mdump -a 0x39000000 -b 131072 > /usb/NSSTCM.BIN

and command for dumping Hawkeye IMEM is:

	mdump -a 0x38000000 -b 393216 > /usb/NSSIMEM.BIN

Therefore, at least two memory regions need to be dumpped for NSS FW debug.


2) How to collect crash dump
When each sub system crashes, the sub system will generate crash dump in DDR,
then trigger system panic for reboot. To prevent panic happening during NSS FW
crash in order to collect crash dump (core dump), following commands need to be
issued after system boot up:

	echo -1 > /proc/sys/dev/nss/general/coredump
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic

This tells NSS sub system do not panic after generate core dump, and do not reboot
if system does panic.
Instead, NSS core dump process will print following message to the console:


	NSS core 0 signal COREDUMP COMPLETE
	NSS core 1 signal COREDUMP COMPLETE
	NSS core dump completed and please use mdump to collect dump data

After seeing this message, mount a USB drive and use mdump to get dump data
described in section 1, then send them to NSS engineer for analysis.
